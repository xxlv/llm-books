In this chapter, we will dive into the world of Express.js, a powerful web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a robust set of features and tools.

To start off, let's explore how to create routes in Express.js. Routes define the endpoints of your application and determine how it responds to client requests. Here's an example of creating a basic route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, we use the `app.get()` method to define a route for the root URL ("/"). When a client makes a GET request to this endpoint, the server responds with the message "Hello, Express!".

Express.js also allows us to handle middleware, which are functions that have access to the request and response objects. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling. Here's an example of using middleware in Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, we define a middleware function called `logger` that logs the HTTP method and URL of each request. We then use the `app.use()` method to apply this middleware to all routes. When a client makes a request, the logger middleware is executed before the route handler.

Express.js is also well-suited for building RESTful APIs. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Express.js provides a clean and intuitive way to define RESTful routes. Here's an example of creating a RESTful API using Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// GET /api/users
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and send a list of users
});

// POST /api/users
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  // Create a new user
});

// PUT /api/users/:id
app.put('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Update a user with the specified ID
});

// DELETE /api/users/:id
app.delete('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Delete a user with the specified ID
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, we define routes for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting users. The `:id` parameter allows us to specify a specific user by their ID.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with Express.js. You will be able to create routes, handle middleware, and build RESTful APIs using this powerful framework. So let's dive in and unlock the full potential of Express.js for your web development projects.
