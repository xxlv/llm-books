Chapter 3: Working with Data Structures

In this chapter, we will explore the different data structures available in Lisp and how they can be effectively used in functional programming. Understanding these data structures is crucial for manipulating and organizing data in a functional programming paradigm.

1. Arrays:
Arrays in Lisp are ordered collections of elements, where each element can be accessed using an index. They provide efficient random access and are commonly used for storing and manipulating large amounts of data. Here's an example of creating and accessing an array:

```lisp
(defvar my-array #(1 2 3 4 5)) ; Creating an array

(format t "Element at index 2: ~a" (aref my-array 2)) ; Accessing element at index 2
```

Output:
Element at index 2: 3

2. Hash Tables:
Hash tables in Lisp are key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key. They provide efficient lookup and insertion operations, making them suitable for tasks like caching and indexing. Here's an example of creating and accessing a hash table:

```lisp
(defvar my-hash-table (make-hash-table)) ; Creating a hash table

(setf (gethash "name" my-hash-table) "John") ; Setting a value for the key "name"
(setf (gethash "age" my-hash-table) 25) ; Setting a value for the key "age"

(format t "Name: ~a, Age: ~a" (gethash "name" my-hash-table) (gethash "age" my-hash-table)) ; Accessing values
```

Output:
Name: John, Age: 25

3. Trees:
Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. They are commonly used for representing hierarchical relationships or organizing data in a tree-like structure. In Lisp, trees can be implemented using lists or custom data structures. Here's an example of creating and traversing a tree using lists:

```lisp
(defvar my-tree '(1 (2 (3) (4)) (5))) ; Creating a tree using lists

(defun traverse-tree (tree)
  (when tree
    (format t "~a " (car tree))
    (traverse-tree (cadr tree))
    (traverse-tree (caddr tree))))

(format t "Tree traversal: ")
(traverse-tree my-tree)
```

Output:
Tree traversal: 1 2 3 4 5

By understanding and utilizing these data structures effectively, you can enhance your functional programming skills and solve complex problems more efficiently. In the next chapter, we will delve into the power of higher-order functions and how they can be leveraged in functional programming.
